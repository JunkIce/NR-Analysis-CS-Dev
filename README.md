**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. A LOT OF THINGS ARE BROKEN.**

A python framework for doing analysis on Nuclear Receptor protein structures

Python prereqs:
- Version 3.11.9+ with all standard libraries (Might work on 3.5+, but no gurantees)
- These Packages (see getPackages.sh to do this quickly):
    - biopython
    - alive-progress
    - numpy
    - periodictable
    - networkx


KNOWN ISSUES:
- UP_Codes is incomplete
